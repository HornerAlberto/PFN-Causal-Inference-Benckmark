Welcome! This repo is created to upload results on Causal PFN-based benchmarking.

You can find preliminar results in the [Benchmark notebook](https://github.com/HornerAlberto/PFN-Causal-Inference-Benckmark/blob/main/benchmarknotebook.ipynb)

The results in the above notebook were presented in a [Causal Python Newsletter post](https://horneralberto.github.io/blog/PFN-Benchmark/)

The following work is to be done:

- Clarity and variety on synthetic data
- Front door, and mediator scenarios
- Include Do-PFN
